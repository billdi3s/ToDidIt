# Roadmap – Beyond the Time Canvas MVP

This roadmap is directional and should be revisited as the product evolves.

## Near‑term (after MVP)

- Add analytics views (daily, weekly, monthly patterns).
- Add reporting templates for day / week / month reviews.
- Improve visual design via a focused “Design Wizard” pass.
- Introduce richer activity and tag hierarchies.
- Add lightweight editing for blocks and occupations.

## Mid‑term

- Integrate tasks and notes layers into the Time Canvas.
- Add template‑driven check‑in flows and rituals.
- Enhance gap analytics (drift detection, streaks, focus metrics).
- Introduce additional dimensions on blocks (energy, context, location).

## Long‑term

- Support multi‑user / team workspaces.
- Build out “BillOS” as a full personal OS on top of this time layer.
- Allow pluggable modules (OKRs, CRM‑like contacts, finances) anchored to the Time Canvas.

When making architectural decisions in the MVP, prefer options that keep these paths open
without prematurely building them.
